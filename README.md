## Credits

The client part of the project is inspired from the [BBRF client](https://github.com/honoki/bbrf-client) by @honoki. This is what I was using before I started this project, so I made it work in the same way,

## Getting Started

### ðŸ’» Local Docker Compose

Please refer to the [Docker Compose Deployment](docs/docker_compose_deployment.md) for more information on how to setup the project using Docker Compose.

OR

### ðŸš€ Deployment Options

1. [Docker Compose Deployment](docs/docker_compose_deployment.md) - For single-node setups
2. [Docker Swarm Deployment](docs/docker_swarm_deployment.md) - For distributed deployments

### ðŸ“¦ Install the h3xrecon client

Refer to the [Client Documentation](docs/client.md) for more information on how to install the h3xrecon client.

### ðŸš€ Start using it !

Setup your first program

```bash
# Create a new program
h3xrecon program add program_name
# Add a scope to the program
h3xrecon -p program_name config add scope ".*example.com"
# Add a cidr to the program
h3xrecon -p program_name config add cidr "1.2.3.4/24"
# Send a job to the program
h3xrecon -p program_name sendjob resolve_domain example.com
# View data
h3xrecon -p program_name list domains/urls/ips/services
```

For more information on the commands, please refer to the [Client Documentation](docs/client.md).
